# ReadMe

This is the repository in which you might find clarification for most things regarding basics of web designing and programming.

## Used tools

I recommend using Notepad++, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2017/19. I use a pretty specific set of plugins, but I think that by knowing contents of my other repos, you might be able to figure out what do you need.

I also recommend using a Windows-based environment, virtual or not. It's just more natural for all these tools. Besides, Wine doesn't really work with regular dotNET.

## Getting started

Depending on what you want to do, you should choose between the 2 folders: **web** and **csharp**. I'm trying to keep everything sorted. Don't worry, most of the code is commented. If you ever get confused, just read the comments explaining the specific bit of code.

The wiki won't be maintained as well as my wikis on C# and F#, as controlling these from Visual Studio is... pretty much impossible. Wikis aren't stored inside of repositories, so you should rely on the comments and this trash **README** file.

Either way, I hope this will be of any help.
